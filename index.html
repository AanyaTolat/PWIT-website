  <h6><strong>Welcome to the Women in Tech Club! We are a motivated group of female coders who bring in influential
      speakers to
      share their experince in the tech world. We inspire our fellow women in tech to become more brave and bold through our various club activities and speakers, which are able to bring the school community together and spark a
      love of technology in many girls.</strong></h6>
