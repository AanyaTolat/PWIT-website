  <!-- This is the section where we highlight our mission statement -->
  <h6><strong>Welcome to the Women in Tech Club! We are a motivated group of female coders who bring in influential
      speakers to
      share their experience in the tech world. We inspire our fellow women in tech to become more brave and bold through our various club activities and speakers, which are able to bring the school community together and spark a
      love of technology in many girls.</strong></h6>

  <!-- This is the section where we would eventually link our Zoom recordings from our past events for people in our Women in Tech Club to access. Currently, the links do not actually lead to these recordings, but when we adapt our website for club use, they will be put in place.  -->
