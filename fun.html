<!-- This is just a fun section where we have embedded a game of Gin Rummy into the website. In our Computer Science classes, part of the curriculum is to eventually make a game, such as Rummy or Poker, so this is just showing people how the game would work and also giving them something fun and interactive to do on the website. -->
